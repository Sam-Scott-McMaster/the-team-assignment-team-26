Your inner villain is Scar!

What does that mean?

You have deep aspirations, motivated by your thirst for power and recognition. You excel in creating long-term plans and spotting opportunities, which can often require using other people's weaknesses for personal gain.

You know how to influence people to support your beliefs with persuasion and confident leadership. However, you may lack empathy, which can lead to isolation.

As a result, balancing your high ambition with empathy can help you build stronger relationships! Maybe try to view others as partners rather than competitors to encourage personal fulfillment and long-term success.
