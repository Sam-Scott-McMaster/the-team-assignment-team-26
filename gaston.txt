Your inner villain is Gaston!

What does that mean?

You have a larger-than-life personality and a strong belief in your abilities....sometimes so strong it might come across as overconfidence!

You thrive on admiration and enjoy being the center of attention, but don’t forget to balance it with a touch of humility.

Gaston’s approach to life is bold and unapologetic, but there’s always room to explore new perspectives. Maybe try diving into some books or challenging yourself to expand your worldview!

A little self-reflection can go a long way—Gaston’s confidence with a sprinkle of kindness and respect could make you unstoppable!
