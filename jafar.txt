Your inner villain is Jafar!

What does that mean?

You have a strong drive to rise above the crowd, and your ambition is unparalleled. You might find it difficult to settle for anything less than being in charge. So it can be said, you thrive when you’re in control.

At times, you may rely on manipulation or cunning strategies to get ahead, which can make you appear deceitful to others. Your confidence and flair can border on pompous, but it’s also part of what makes you stand out.

Jafar’s thirst for power and dislike of being second to anyone are traits that can be channeled into positive leadership—when balanced with humilit and empathy. Focus on inspiring others instead of controlling them, and your inner Jafar could transform into a force for good!
