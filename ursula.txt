Your inner villain is Ursula. 


To put it nicely, you are a master manipulator. Skilled at convincing others with your charm and persuasive words, you end up getting exactly what you want with ease. You'd do well in the world of business, spending the rest of your life swindling the desperate.

Your cunning and ability to strike pragmatic, albeit self-serving, bargains make you both feared and respected. 


Evil much?
