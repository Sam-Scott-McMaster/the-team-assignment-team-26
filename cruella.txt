You sure do love a good fur coat that matches your favourite shoes. Because let's face it, you love to present yourself at your best so you can hide your carelessness and impulsiveness on the inside. If someone gets on your nerves, your impulsive side might just leave a trail of chaos in its wake. But hey, there's always good that comes with the bad. The truth is, you get things done. You're ambitious and goal-oriented, and you don't take no for an answer. You hate indecisive people because YOU know exactly what you want in life, so why can’t everyone else get their act together? Your problem-solving skills are exquisite—give you a challenge, and you’ll crack it with flair. Competitive? Nahh, your fiery spirit just drives you to seize opportunities like prized treasures (hopefully not the coats of adorable Dalmatian puppies, though!).
